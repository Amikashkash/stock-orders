# Feature Roadmap & Development Plan

## 🔴 CRITICAL FIXES (Do First!)

### 1. Fix Duplicate Orders Bug ⚠️ URGENT
**Problem:** Users clicking save button repeatedly creates duplicate orders
**Priority:** 🔥 Critical - Data integrity issue
**Effort:** 1-2 hours
**Implementation:** Add button state management and debouncing to CreateOrderView.js

### 2. Better Navigation in Order Details View
**Problem:** Need to scroll to top for back button, scroll to bottom for notes
**Priority:** 🔥 High - Daily pain point
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Solution:** Sticky header with back button + floating action button for notes

## 🎯 PHASE 1: Essential Improvements (Week 1-2)

### 3. Human-Readable Order Numbers ⭐
**Feature:** Replace Firebase IDs with sequential numbers (ORD-0001, ORD-0002, etc.)
**Why:** Easy to reference orders verbally and in communication
**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Implementation:**
- Add counter document in Firebase
- Generate sequential displayId on order creation
- Update all views to show displayId instead of Firebase ID

### 4. Visual Date Grouping in Order History ⭐
**Feature:** Group orders by date with sticky headers ("היום", "אתמול", "15 באוקטובר")
**Why:** Easier to find orders chronologically
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Implementation:** Group orders by date in OrderHistoryView.js with visual separators

### 5. Sort Order History by Date ⭐
**Feature:** Show most recent orders first
**Why:** Users care about recent orders most
**Effort:** 15 minutes
**Status:** May already be implemented - verify orderBy("createdAt", "desc")

### 6. Edit Unpicked Orders ⭐
**Feature:** Allow order creator to edit pending orders before picking starts
**Why:** Fix mistakes without creating new order
**Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Implementation:**
- Add edit button in OrderHistoryView for pending orders
- Create EditOrderView.js (similar to CreateOrderView)
- Check permissions: only creator + status must be "pending"
- Update existing order instead of creating new one

**Effort:** 4-5 hours

### 13. Advanced Search
**Feature:** Search orders by customer name, product, date, notes
**Why:** Quick lookup of specific orders
**Effort:** 3-4 hours

### 14. Print Picking Lists
